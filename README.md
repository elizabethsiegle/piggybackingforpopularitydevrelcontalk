- [ ] What is Piggybacking? 🐷

    Building content that **rides the momentum of existing hype**—e.g.:
- trending event (e.g. [March Madness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTvfjudifDg), sports finals, Oscars)
- product launch (e.g. model, [OpenAI Realtime API](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcOytsfva0o&t=312s))
- pop culture (e.g.🎥🍿)
- viral meme || Tiktok sound
- a holiday (e.g. [Mean Girls Day](https://x.com/lizziepika/status/1841965146081787931/), [Thanksgiving](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/blog/developers/tutorials/integrations/safe-to-say-at-thanksgiving-transfer-learning-sms), [Intl Talk Like a Pirate Day](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/blog/developers/tutorials/integrations/translator-via-sms-with-c-and-azure-functions))

- [ ] Why Piggyback?

- **Social media, !SEO**  
  Timely content spreads faster than regular content.

- **Mind-share is fleeting**  
  Trends are short-lived. Attention is a currency—strike while hot.
